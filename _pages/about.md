# About Me
* I am a Data Scientist at [BHP](https://www.bhp.com/) by day and a hobbyiest NLP Research Scientist at night. I hold a Ph.D in Computer Science from [University of South Australia](https://www.unisa.edu.au/), supervised by Prof. [Jiuyong Li](https://people.unisa.edu.au/Jiuyong.Li). My PhD Disertation was geared towards developing data mining and machine learning techniques to extract insights from social media  to Predict, Detect and Summarize Civil Unrest.

* My research interests lie in the general area of  machine learning, particularly in natural language processing, social media behavorial modelling, low resource languages, graph theory, as well as their applications in event prediction, text summarization, and language translation. 

* I received my Bachelor’s Degree in  Computer Science and Engineering from [University of Mines and Technology, Ghana](http://umat.edu.gh/).

<!-- 
I grew up in Accra, Ghana, in a family of easy going ambitous folks. My love for research in Computer Science brought me to Australia in my early twenties to study a PhD in Data Mining and Machine Learning. After 3  exciting years of working on innovative NLP and ML research with the D2DCRC, I submitted my PhD Thesis with Distinction. Finishing my PhD brought me to a crossroad, where I was not too sure whether I wanted to in Industry or Academia. To have a feel of how working in the industry feels like, I move to the Brisbane to work as a Data Science Specialist with the largest mining company in world - BHP (yeap that happended, i feel blessed for that).
